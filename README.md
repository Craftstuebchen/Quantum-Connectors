# Quantum-Connectors [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Craftstuebchen/Quantum-Connectors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Craftstuebchen/Quantum-Connectors)
Replacement for Quantum Circuits

This work is a fork from https://github.com/Ne0nx3r0/Quantum-Connectors.
The base idea came from there but this is a complete rewrite of the plugin.
This project is now modular. Sender and receiver can be added from a module.
